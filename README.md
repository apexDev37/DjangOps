## Introduction

If you need a quick start with Django and Compose, you're in the right place.
DjangOps is a dev-ops-inspired template for perfectionists with deadlines,
who also happen to love Django and compose! Spin up a local dev environment
with modular custom settings in a few steps and focus on the value you want to
build. All comments, feedback, and contributions are highly encouraged.
I always love to hear and learn from the community❤

Learn more about the Django framework from the official [documentation].

## Installing / Getting started

This is an overview of the minimal setup needed to get started.

### Prerequisites

- [Git]
- [Docker Desktop] (latest version)
- IDE/Code/Text editor ([PyCharm], [VScode], [Vim], etc)

Follow these tutorials to set up Docker and Compose on either [Mac]
or [Linux].  
I'd recommend Microsoft's documentation to set up [Docker on WSL2] if you're on Windows.

### Local Setup

> The following setup was run on Ubuntu focal (20.04.6 LTS)

You can clone this repo with the following command.

- Clone repository

```bash
# cd your/desired/target/dir
➜ git clone git@github.com:apexDev37/DjangOps.git my-project
➜ cd my-project
```

> 🛈 This will clone the repository to a target dir on your host machine with
 a custom name `my-project/` and navigate into its root dir.

### Configuration
>
> The following commands assume execution occurs at the project root.

Before running your application with Compose, configure [environment] variables
and [secrets] expected by the Compose app model. Sample `env` and `secret`
files are provided to configure the following services: `web` and `db`. You can
create the required config files with the following `make` target commands.
After the config files are created, replace the placeholders and empty `txt`
files with your custom values.

> 🛈 `secret` files should store sensitive or confidential data, whereas `env`
files can contain other environment-related config.  

- Create required config files

```bash
# idempotent operations.
➜ make envs && make secrets
```

> 🛈 This will create and output all config files generated from available
sample files in their target directory
(ie. `django.env.example` -> `django.env`).  

- Update placeholder config values  

> 💡 `secret` files intended to store keys or passwords are auto-populated with
> a random, cryptographic, base64-encoded value.

### Launch

You're all set to run your Django application.
Spin up your Django and Postgres instances with the following command.

- Spin up containers

```bash
➜ docker compose down
➜ docker compose up -d
```

> 🛈 This will create and start the Django and Postgres instances in the same
network defined in the base `compose` file.

Once the containers have been created and started, you can access the
application at <http://localhost:8000>

## Licensing

To make a repository open source, you must license it so that others may freely
use, modify, and distribute the software. Using the [MIT license], this project
ensures this. The full original text version of the license may be seen [here].
