# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.
#
# NB: Pinned versions here are primarily for production (base) requirements,
#     with preference to use the latest (dev) and (quality) tools.


# Pin to major (LTS) version 4.2,
# Allow updates within 4.2.x,
# NB: Django policy keeps deprecation shims for at least two feature releases (4.2, 5.0).
#     Permit upgrade to Django 5.0 after testing in a tox (django50) environment.
django>=4.2.x,<5.0.0

# Pin to minor version 0.11 (minimum for Django 4 support),
# Allow minor and patch updates,
# Prevent upgrades to 1.0.0 (potential breaking changes).
django-environ>=0.11.x,<1.0.0

# Pin to version 2.9.9 (minimum for both Python 3.12 and PostgreSQL 16 support),
# Allow minor and patch updates,
# Prevent upgrades to 3.0.0 (potential breaking changes).
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.9,<3.0.0
